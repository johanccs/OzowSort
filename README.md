# OzowSort
The idea was to find a better sort algorithm. I created a an array to hold the alphabet in lowercase. The app service will translate the input into integers by comparing against the array. The integer translation is then sorted (could not find a custom sorting algorithm). Sorting the integer array should be quicker than sorting the string array. After sorting the integer array, the final result is constructed by again comparing the int array against the string array. This way no punctuation will make it into the final result without checking for it specifically. A check is built in to make the character lowercase although it is not necessary.

In both Ozow assessments - depdency injection is used as a design pattern to inject the service classes into main. This allows for easy testability and in the event of implementing a better solution.
